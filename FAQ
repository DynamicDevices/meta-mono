Q. How do I create a recipe to build a Mono/.NET application within Yocto/OpenEmbedded

See wiki instructions

https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Building_and_running_embedded_Linux_.NET_applications_from_first_principles

Also see mono-hellowworld example recipes

http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-mono/tree/recipes-mono/mono-helloworld

- mono-helloworld is based on the Mono example, mono-skel, and provides files needed to build with autotools

This recipe now provides a console "hello world" demo and if "x11" is in DISTRO_FEATURES in
the configuration it will also build a Windows Forms demo, and a GTK# demo

- mono-helloworld-xbuild uses a Visual Studio solution and project files with Mono xbuild

Q. How do I set the version of Mono that I wish to build?

A. Modify your conf/local.conf file to include the following

For Mono 3.12.1

PREFERRED_VERSION_mono = "3.12.1"
PREFERRED_VERSION_mono-native = "3.12.1"

For Mono 4.0.3.19

PREFERRED_VERSION_mono = "4.0.3.19"
PREFERRED_VERSION_mono-native = "4.0.3.19"

Q. How do I include Mono in an image?

A. Ideally you would wish to create an image recipe that inherits a base image recipe,
or .bbappends to a base image recipe, possibly in a new layer.

The core-image-mono in recipes-mono/images shows how to do this. In core-image-mono.bb
we require core-image-sato (i.e. base our mono image on the sato image) and in addition
we require core-image-mono.inc. In the include file we add Mono to the output image

IMAGE_INSTALL += "libgdiplus mono mono-helloworld"

So you can modify your own image recipe(s) in this manner. However in the simplest case 
for testing you can add the following to your conf/local.conf to add packages to every 
image built

IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " mono"

Q. How do I use Mono 3.x.x on Windows?

A. See the articles here on building the Mono sources under Windows
 
3.4.x / 3.6.x
