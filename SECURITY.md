# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the meta-mono layer or its recipes:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Email the maintainer(s) directly. See the [README](README.md) "Maintainer(s) & Patch policy" section for current contact details.
3. Include a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any impact assessment.

We will acknowledge your report and work with you to understand and address the issue. We ask that you allow a reasonable time for a fix before any public disclosure.

## Scope

This policy applies to the meta-mono layer metadata (recipes, classes, configuration) and to security issues in how the layer builds or configures software. For vulnerabilities in upstream projects (Mono, .NET, libgdiplus, etc.), please follow those projects’ own security reporting guidelines.
